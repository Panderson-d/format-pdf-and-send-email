# format-pdf-and-send-email
Script that iterates through sales data and sends email with formatted pdf. Script finds the year where the most sales occured, the highest selling vehichle by revenue and the vehichle with the most unit sales. Then it converts it to pdf with table data. Script was halfway complete, I completed the Todo's to make the script work correctly.
